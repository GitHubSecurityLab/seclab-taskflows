        Fetch the file {{ result.user }} from the repo {{ result.repo }}.
        
        Get the high privileged triggers for the workflow in the file {{ result.user }} and check if it is reusable. 
        If it does not contain any high privileged trigger AND it is not a reusable action, then the task is done.

        Otherwise, check that the action specified by {{ result.user }} in repo {{ result.repo }} is active.
        To do so, fetch the workflow from GitHub using the `workflow_id` derived from {{ result.user }}.
        Then check the workflow state, if it is not `active`, then the task is done.

        Otherwise, from the file {{ result.user }}, take note of the following:
        1. All the triggers of the action {{ result.user }}.
        2. All the high privileged triggers of {{ result.user }}, if any. You must clearly state that these are high privileged triggers.
        2. Any permissions granted to the {{ result.user }} action.
        3. Any secrets used in the {{ result.user }} action.

        Update the notes and alert results as follows:
        You must mention the fact that {{ result.user }} uses {{ result.action }} in lines {{ result.lines }}
        in the notes.
        You must also include all the permissions granted to the {{ result.user }} action in the notes, and all the triggers of the action.
        Finally, update all the alert results that have {{ result.action }} with the results in your notes using `update_all_alert_results_for_flow_graph` with
        your notes as the `results`, {{ result.action }} as the `next` and {{ result.repo }} as the `repo`.
